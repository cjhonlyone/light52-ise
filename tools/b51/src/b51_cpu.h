/**
    @file b51_cpu.h
    @brief CPU model.

    This file includes the CPU simulation model. Excludes the behavior of the
    CPU peripherals, which is done in b51_mcu.c.

    When implementing different CPU core models, you should modify this file
    by adding conditional code and new functions. Differences between CPU
    cores are going to be small enough -- cycle counts, implementation of
    certain instructions, etc.

    Different cores will have a different set of peripherals, though. That must
    be modelled with a function pointer table against different b51_mcu
    implementations -- meaning one different source file per different core.

    TODO CPU & MCU polymorphism to be done.
